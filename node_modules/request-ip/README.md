[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/pbojinov/request-ip/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/pbojinov/request-ip)

## Installation

    npm install request-ip
    
## Getting Started

```javascript
var requestIp = require('request-ip');

// inside middleware handler
var ipMiddleware = function(req, res, next) {
    var clientIp = requestIp.getClientIp(req); // on localhost > 127.0.0.1
    next();
};
```

## How It Works

It looks for specific headers in the request and falls back to some defaults if they do not exist.

The following is the order we use to determine the user ip from the request.

1. `X-Client-IP`  
2. `X-Forwarded-For` header may return multiple IP addresses in the format: "client IP, proxy 1 IP, proxy 2 IP", so we take the the first one.
3. `X-Real-IP` (nginx proxy/FastCGI)
5. `X-Cluster-Client-IP` (Rackspace LB, Riverbed Stingray)
6. Permuations of #2 such as: `X-Forwarded`, `Forwarded-For` and `Forwarded`
7. `req.connection.remoteAddress`
8. `req.socket.remoteAddress`
9. `req.connection.socket.remoteAddress`
